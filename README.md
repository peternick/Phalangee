# Phalangee
Phalangee (fah-lan-gee) is a basic typing test program that allows users to discover how fast they can type. The user has a typing field towards the bottom of the main screen where they type in the corresponding bolded word of the paragraph in the middle panel. Each time they type a word correctly and press the spacebar, the bolded word will advance to the next word in the sentence. Once one minute has passed, the user will be able to see their words per minute (abbreviated as WPM). The user's typing statistics will be saved to a Mongo Database once a game is over. Multiple users are able to access their past game information once they have created an account within the application.

<h1> Plans for the application </h1>
This is a work in progress, so I plan to:
<ul>
  <li> Make the GUI more visually appealing </li>
  <li> Implement a graph that shows how the user has performed over time </li>
  <li> More paragraphs for the user to type off of </li>
</ul>
