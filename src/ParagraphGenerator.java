	private static String paragraph1 = "Trefis estimates Beyond Meat valuation to be around $110, reflecting a potential decline of about 17% from its current level. The trigger is the expected hit of close to $70 million that Beyond Meat is likely to take to its incremental revenues in 2020. We expect Beyond Meat’s revenues to come in at $455 million in 2020, about $70 million lower than our previous estimate of $525 million. This marks a y-o-y revenue growth of 53% compared to the 76% projected before the current crisis hit the world. The decrease in the revenue projection is mainly due to the ongoing lockdown, leading to the shutting down of restaurants and many retail stores. Increase in partial employment has decreased consumer spending, thus affecting demand for BYND’s products. This was evident from the recently released Q2 results of the company where the impact of the pandemic was palpable. Though Beyond Meat’s revenues increased by 68% y-o-y, the entire growth came only from the retail division. The company’s restaurant segment - which has been the fastest growing segment for Beyond Meat over recent years and in fact surpassed retail as the biggest revenue contributor in 2019 – saw its revenue decline by 58% y-o-y in Q2 2020. Though the company’s net income margin improved slightly in Q2 2020 on y-o-y basis, this was mainly due to one-time charges in the year ago period. Performance in Q2 2020 has in fact deteriorated as is evident from the decline in gross margin from 33.8% in Q2 2019 to 29.7% in Q2 2020. Also, BYND reported an operating loss of $8.2 million in Q2 2020 as against an operating profit of $2.2 million in Q2 2019. Deterioration in profitability was driven by costs related to product repacking activities due to Covid, increased headcount, higher share-based compensation, increased marketing expenses, and R&D cost.BYND experienced a meaningful slowdown in its food service business as various regions around the world implemented stay-at-home orders, resulting in the closure or limited operations of many of its food service customers. Though recently there have been signs of reopening of the economy and lifting of lockdowns which led to a surge in stock price, most food service customers are operating under various local restrictions and continue to navigate a highly uncertain environment. Also, the recent surge in Covid positive cases in the US could prove to be an impediment in the path of the company’s healthy growth, as re-imposition of lockdowns will lead to a further decrease in the revenue growth outlook. Amidst this uncertainty, the management has suspended its previous full year outlook. Another Covid wave and lockdown could put Beyond Meat’s strategic initiatives at risk. The company has focused on growing its restaurant and food service business by recently entering into partnerships with Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s. These restaurant chains operating partially (with only take home services allowed right now) for a prolonged period would mean Beyond Meat’s near-term strategy going awry and not getting the desired results.For the full year 2020, total revenue is expected to be $455 million but the company is expected to again report losses despite operations turning profitable for the first time in 2019. Once lockdowns are lifted, revenue is expected to rise to $680 million in FY2021 but the increase in shares outstanding is expected to limit the growth in revenue per share which is expected to rise to close to $11 in 2021 from $7 currently. With the near-term outlook remaining uncertain, healthy revenue and margin growth coming in only once the Covid tide subsides and lockdowns are lifted, and with the effect of the company’s strategic initiatives not expected to be felt anytime soon, the company’s P/S multiple could see a 50% decline from the current 20x to about 10x. RPS of $11 and P/S multiple of 10x suggests that Beyond Meat’s stock could drop to $110 in the near term, reflecting a potential downside of around 17% from its current level.See how Beyond Meat’s P/S valuation multiple stands in comparison to its peers Tyson Foods and Kellogg.

	private static String paragraph2 = "So much of our daily lives runs on electricity, yet most of us don\'t know the difference between a 60-watt and 75-watt light bulb, or how voltage from the wall socket supplies enough juice to run both a small desk lamp and a powerful microwave. ­The­ three most basic units in electricity are voltage (V), current (I, uppercase \"i\") and resistance (R). Voltage is measured in volts, current is measured in amps and resistance is measured in ohms. A neat analogy to help understand these terms is a system of plumbing pipes. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size. There is a basic equation in electrical engineering that states how the three terms relate. It says that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance or I = V/R. This is known as Ohm\'s law. Let\'s see how this relation applies to the plumbing system. Let\'s say you have a tank of pressurized water connected to a hose that you are using to water the garden. What happens if you increase the pressure in the tank? You probably can guess that this makes more water come out of the hose. The same is true of an electrical system: Increasing the voltage will make more current flow. Let\'s say you increase the diameter of the hose and all of the fittings to the tank. You probably guessed that this also makes more water come out of the hose. This is like decreasing the resistance in an electrical system, which increases the current flow. Electrical power is measured in watts. In an electrical system power (P) is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current. The water analogy still applies. Take a hose and point it at a waterwheel like the ones that were used to turn grinding stones in watermills. You can increase the power generated by the waterwheel in two ways. If you increase the pressure of the water coming out of the hose, it hits the waterwheel with a lot more force and the wheel turns faster, generating more power. If you increase the flow rate, the waterwheel turns faster because of the weight of the extra water hitting it. In an electrical system, increasing either the current or the voltage will result in higher power. Let\'s say you have a system with a 6-volt light bulb hooked up to a 6-volt battery. The power output of the light bulb is 100 watts. Using the equation I = P/V, we can calculate how much current in amps would be required to get 100 watts out of this 6-volt bulb. You know that P = 100 W, and V = 6 V. So, you can rearrange the equation to solve for I and substitute in the numbers. I = 100 W/6 V = 16.67 amps What would happen if you use a 12-volt battery and a 12-volt light bulb to get 100 watts of power? I = 100 W/12 V = 8.33 amps So, this latter system produces the same power, but with half the current. There is an advantage that comes from using less current to make the same amount of power. The resistance in electrical wires consumes power, and the power consumed increases as the current going through the wires increases. You can see how this happens by doing a little rearranging of the two equations. What you need is an equation for power in terms of resistance and current. Let\'s rearrange the first equation: I = V/R can be restated as V = I*R Now you can substitute the equation for V into the other equation: P = V*I substituting for V we get P = I*R*I, or P = I2*R What this equation tells you is that the power consumed by the wires increases if the resistance of the wires increases (for instance, if the wires get smaller or are made of a less conductive material). But it increases dramatically if the current going through the wires increases. So, using a higher voltage to reduce the current can make electrical systems more efficient. The efficiency of electric motors also improves at higher voltages. This improvement in efficiency is what drove the automobile industry to consider switching from 12-volt electrical systems to 42-volt systems in the 1990s. As more cars shipped with electric-powered amenities — video displays, seat heaters, \"smart\" climate control — they required thick bundles of wiring to supply enough current. Switching to a higher-voltage system would provide more power with thinner-gauge wiring. The switch never happened, because carmakers were able to boost efficiencies with digital technology and more efficient electric pumps at 12 volts. But some new models employ hybrid systems with a separate 48-volt generator to power advanced features like idle shut-off while increasing overall system efficiency.";
	private static String paragraph3 = "Whales have been known to be the largest animals on Earth! They are also being known as sea creature that are mammals. They are weight 200 tons in average and can stretch up to 100 feet long. Which is as long as a professional basketball court. We often see in the news about those big whales that dies and being wash away to the beach. Did you know that after some time, these whales could explode? Dead whale Oregon One case that happened in UK, the police even warn the people nearby to stay atleast 40 feet away from the dead whale. Because when you poking the whale, you are giving it more reason to explode! Now why do they explode? Is it just whales or same goes with the other sea life creature? This started with a bad case of gas. When a whale die, it will take some time to build up gases in its stomach and other organs. This gas is known as Methane gas. What usually happen next is, this whale will balloon up twice from its original size. At this point, the whale deflates slowly as the gas seeps out. Then the skin begins to disintegrate, at which point the whale deflates slowly as the gas seeps out. One step before explode, the skin will keep stretching to accommodate the gas until it reaches breaking. Now let’s take a look on how does this dead whale can produce methane gas. When a creature died, the death itself has 8 staged that this dead creature will phase through. It starts with Pallor Mortis and ends with Fossilization. The stage where this dead animal will start to produce Methane is at stage 5. The stage where this dead animal will start to produce Methane is at stage 5. In this situation, putrefaction and fermentation are likely the culprits. According to Wolfgang Weinmann, during putrefaction the proteins in an animal’s tissues break down. Weinmann is a forensic toxicologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland. This is the main process that produces the smelly gas call Methane gas. It’s also what causes organ liquefaction. On the other hand, he also added that fermentation also take places in this stage in which various of tissues dry out.In this process, it’s also produces a number of other gases, such as carbon dioxide. Therefore, when putrefaction and fermentation come together, you can sometimes end up with a spectacularly bloated carcass. This is why a dead whale on the beach can balloon up twice from its original size. And because whales have a thick layer of blubber beneath their skin, air trapped within stays mainly in the whale until its skin degrades. Could be until someone decides it’s time to relieve all that pressure. According to Mate, these impressive explosions are mainly caused by the size. When decomposition is taking place in such a large animal, more gas and pressure that build up inside its remains. This means that all dead animal and human going through the same process and also produces methane gas. But you not going to see this type of explosion if the dead animal is squirrel or gold fish. Mate added that the pressure builds up in these kinds of animals will eventually release itself. The animals will slowly deflate themselves. Bruce Mate is a director of the marine biology institute at Oregon State University. Mate has dealt with a lot of dead whales throughout his career, so he’s also experienced in handling bloated whales that wash off to the beach. Methane gas explosion Whenever a dead whale landed on the beach and already bloated, there is a special team that will handle this kind of situation. But the handling process could go badly if someone is being careless. To deflate this whale, it could be a catastrophic. There was a case when people went near to this dead whale and stand on it. When the whale explodes, they were blown about 30 to 50 feet away. However, there were also few cases where the whale died and slowly sink to the bottom of the sea. When this happen, the dead whale will eventually become food to the other animals below. Dead whales Sadly, there are also some people that think preserve the skeleton of these whales as a tourist attraction. But to maintain the skeleton condition after preserved is not feasible. According to Mate, its expensive and complicated. What’s complicated is, you have to remove all the soft tissues which is 85% of the whale’s mass. Then you have to dispose the flesh. Plus, it’s a very smelly job. This is why in this situation, it is the best if the dead whale slowly sink at the bottom of the sea. Therefore, beached whales aren’t sights to celebrate since many of its species on the brink of becoming endangered. Nevertheless, it’s certainly easier for people to deal with when it happens in the mammal’s own territory, which is the ocean. Even though it’s sad or unfortunate, whale death benefits other ocean inhabitants because it sparks the beginning of new life.";
	private static String paragraph4 = "What is a healthy diet? For many, this is a difficult question to answer. There's no shortage of dietary options out there, and each one claims to be the healthy option. I don't believe there's a one-size-fits-all approach to diet-or to health, for that matter-but there are characteristics a healthy diet should have. It needs to be nutrient-dense and based on whole foods, not processed or refined foods. It needs to be nourishing and meet the individual needs of the person eating it. The nutrivore diet checks those boxes. nutrivore diet The nutrivore diet emphasizes high-quality, nutrient-dense foods. iStock/mediaphotos Page Contents: [hide] What Is the Nutrivore Diet? The Nutrivore Diet vs. the Standard American Diet What Is a “Healthy Diet”? It Comes Down to Diet Quality and Nutrient Density Three Tips to Eat like a Nutrivore The nutrivore diet emphasizes whole foods that are rich in nutrients while avoiding the processed, inflammatory, and refined foods that drive chronic disease. The term “nutrivore” was coined by Dr. Sarah Ballantyne to describe someone who eats foods that are nutritious and provide the micronutrients our bodies need to be healthy and thrive. In this article, I’ll discuss what the nutrivore diet is—a healthy, whole foods approach to eating—and what it isn’t—the standard American diet. Low-carb, low-fat, Paleo, plant-based … The diet options out there are endless, but what really constitutes a healthy diet? Check out this article to find out. #nutrition #chriskresser What Is the Nutrivore Diet? The nutrivore diet is made up of nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory whole foods like: Meat Organ meat Shellfish and fish Bone broth A variety of fresh fruits and vegetables (including sea vegetables) Nuts Seeds Tubers Starchy plants Nutrivores avoid inflammatory foods like industrial seed oils and refined flour, and avoid things like processed foods and excess sugars. Nutrivores also lead healthy lifestyles. They don’t smoke, they don’t drink excessively, they get plenty of exercise and plenty of sleep, and they manage their stress. The nutrivore diet isn’t nearly as specific or restricted as some others. You won’t find a list of macronutrient ratios you have to hit to call yourself a nutrivore, and there certainly isn’t a one-size-fits-all nutrivore diet plan to follow. The nutrivore diet is all about focusing on the nutritious foods that will nourish your body—whatever that may look like for you. That may mean including grains, legumes, and dairy, if your body tolerates them, or cutting out these things if not. You may find that you thrive on a cyclical ketogenic diet, or you could discover that you feel better with a more moderate carb intake. You might also find success with different eating patterns, like intermittent fasting. We all have individual needs that vary, which means our personal definitions of a healthy diet will vary, too. In fact, the research into the diets of contemporary hunter–gatherers bears that out. There doesn’t appear to be one optimal human diet; instead, some people thrive on higher fat intakes, such as the traditional Inuit of Alaska and the Maasai of East Africa, while others emphasize carbs, like the Kitavans of Melanesia and the Okinawans of Japan. The Nutrivore Diet vs. the Standard American Diet Contemporary and ancestral hunter–gatherer societies have one thing in common: none of them followed traditional diets that were anything like today’s standard American diet. The standard American diet is characterized by processed and refined foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients, and it’s associated with rapidly climbing rates of chronic disease. It’s dominated by nutrient-poor foods like: Refined flour, which can raise blood sugar and cause metabolic dysfunction, and lead to other conditions like weight gain, cardiovascular disease, and many others Industrial seed oils, which can lead to inflammation, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases Excess sugars, which have addictive qualities and may lead to gut dysbiosis, impaired immune function, metabolic syndrome, and other illnesses (11, 12, 13, 14) This diet may be the standard now, but we didn’t always eat like this. The human diet changed fundamentally first with the Agricultural Revolution—when humans began cultivating grain and farming, leaving behind their nomadic, hunter–gatherer lifestyles—and again in recent human history with the invention of advanced food processing techniques. The nutrient-dense, whole foods diet we evolved to eat was replaced as recently as three generations ago, meaning we haven’t had nearly enough time to adapt—and that abrupt dietary shift has had a sobering effect on our health: Six in 10 U.S. adults have a chronic illness. (15) Four in 10 U.S. adults have multiple chronic conditions. (16) One-third of Americans are at risk for nutrient deficiencies or anemia. (17) Nearly 40 percent of Americans are obese. (18) Around 30 million American adults have diabetes, while 84 million have prediabetes. The average life expectancy is dropping in the United States, and the leading causes of death include heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. (20) This is the chronic disease epidemic, but we don’t have to let it continue unchecked. The nutrivore diet is a great antidote to standard American fare. Nutrivores cut out the inflammatory foods mentioned above, instead opting for an eating pattern that more closely resembles the ones our ancestors followed. Eating this way—and living a healthy, ancestral lifestyle—are the core components of ancestral health, and they go a long way toward correcting the genetic mismatch that’s responsible for the rise in chronic disease.";
	private static String paragraph5 = "New Deal, domestic program of the administration of U.S. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt between 1933 and 1939, which took action to bring about immediate economic relief as well as reforms in industry, agriculture, finance, waterpower, labour, and housing, vastly increasing the scope of the federal government’s activities. The term was taken from Roosevelt’s speech accepting the Democratic nomination for the presidency on July 2, 1932. Reacting to the ineffectiveness of the administration of Pres. Herbert Hoover in meeting the ravages of the Great Depression, American voters the following November overwhelmingly voted in favour of the Democratic promise of a “new deal” for the “forgotten man.” Opposed to the traditional American political philosophy of laissez-faire, the New Deal generally embraced the concept of a government-regulated economy aimed at achieving a balance between conflicting economic interests. Much of the New Deal legislation was enacted within the first three months of Roosevelt’s presidency, which became known as the Hundred Days. The new administration’s first objective was to alleviate the suffering of the nation’s huge number of unemployed workers. Such agencies as the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) were established to dispense emergency and short-term governmental aid and to provide temporary jobs, employment on construction projects, and youth work in the national forests. Before 1935 the New Deal focused on revitalizing the country’s stricken business and agricultural communities. To revive industrial activity, the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was granted authority to help shape industrial codes governing trade practices, wages, hours, child labour, and collective bargaining. The New Deal also tried to regulate the nation’s financial hierarchy in order to avoid a repetition of the stock market crash of 1929 and the massive bank failures that followed. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) granted government insurance for bank deposits in member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was formed to protect the investing public from fraudulent stock-market practices. The farm program was centred in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), which attempted to raise prices by controlling the production of staple crops through cash subsidies to farmers. In addition, the arm of the federal government reached into the area of electric power, establishing in 1933 the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which was to cover a seven-state area and supply cheap electricity, prevent floods, improve navigation, and produce nitrates. In 1935 the New Deal emphasis shifted to measures designed to assist labour and other urban groups. The Wagner Act of 1935 greatly increased the authority of the federal government in industrial relations and strengthened the organizing power of labour unions, establishing the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to execute this program. To aid the “forgotten” homeowner, legislation was passed to refinance shaky mortgages and guarantee bank loans for both modernization and mortgage payments. Perhaps the most far-reaching programs of the entire New Deal were the Social Security measures enacted in 1935 and 1939, providing old-age and widows’ benefits, unemployment compensation, and disability insurance. Maximum work hours and minimum wages were also set in certain industries in 1938. Certain New Deal laws were declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that neither the commerce nor the taxing provisions of the Constitution granted the federal government authority to regulate industry or to undertake social and economic reform. Roosevelt, confident of the legality of all the measures, proposed early in 1937 a reorganization of the Court. This proposal met with vehement opposition and ultimate defeat, but the Court meanwhile ruled in favour of the remaining contested legislation. Despite resistance from business and other segments of the community to “socialistic” tendencies of the New Deal, many of its reforms gradually achieved national acceptance. Roosevelt’s domestic programs were largely followed in the Fair Deal of Pres. Harry S. Truman (1945–53), and both major U.S. parties came to accept most New Deal reforms as a permanent part of the national life.";
	private static String paragraph6 = "Electron Transport Chain Definition The electron transport chain is a cluster of proteins that transfer electrons through a membrane within mitochondria to form a gradient of protons that drives the creation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is used by the cell as the energy for metabolic processes for cellular functions. Where Does the Electron Transport Chain Occur? During the process, a proton gradient is created when the protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space of the cell, which also helps in driving ATP production. Often, the use of a proton gradient is referred to as the chemiosmotic mechanism that drives ATP synthesis since it relies on a higher concentration of protons to generate “proton motive force”. The amount of ATP created is directly proportional to the number of protons that are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron transport chain involves a series of redox reactions that relies on protein complexes to transfer electrons from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. As a result of these reactions, the proton gradient is produced, enabling mechanical work to be converted into chemical energy, allowing ATP synthesis. The complexes are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane called the cristae in eukaryotes. Enclosed by the inner mitochondrial membrane is the matrix, which is where necessary enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase are located. The process can also be found in photosynthetic eukaryotes in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and in prokaryotes, but with modifications. By-products from other cycles and processes, like the citric acid cycle, amino acid oxidation, and fatty acid oxidation, are used in the electron transport chain. As seen in the overall redox reaction, 2 H+ + 2 E+ + ½ O2 -> H2O + ENERGY energy is released in an exothermic reaction when electrons are passed through the complexes; three molecules of ATP are created. Phosphate located in the matrix is imported via the proton gradient, which is used to create more ATP. The process of generating more ATP via the phosphorylation of ADP is referred to oxidative phosphorylation since the energy of hydrogen oxygenation is used throughout the electron transport chain. The ATP generated from this reaction go on to power most cellular reactions necessary for life. In the electron transfer chain, electrons move along a series of proteins to generate an expulsion type force to move hydrogen ions, or protons, across the mitochondrial membrane. The electrons begin their reactions in Complex I, continuing onto Complex II, traversed to Complex III and cytochrome c via coenzyme Q, and then finally to Complex IV. The complexes themselves are complex-structured proteins embedded in the phospholipid membrane. They are combined with a metal ion, such as iron, to help with proton expulsion into the intermembrane space as well as other functions. The complexes also undergo conformational changes to allow openings for the transmembrane movement of protons. These four complexes actively transfer electrons from an organic metabolite, such as glucose. When the metabolite breaks down, two electrons and a hydrogen ion are released and then picked up by the coenzyme NAD+ to become NADH, releasing a hydrogen ion into the cytosol. The NADH now has two electrons passing them onto a more mobile molecule, ubiquinone (Q), in the first protein complex (Complex I). Complex I, also known as NADH dehydrogenase, pumps four hydrogen ions from the matrix into the intermembrane space, establishing the proton gradient. In the next protein, Complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, another electron carrier and coenzyme, succinate is oxidized into fumarate, causing FAD (flavin-adenine dinucleotide) to be reduced to FADH2. The transport molecule, FADH2 is then reoxidized, donating electrons to Q (becoming QH2), while releasing another hydrogen ion into the cytosol. While Complex II does not directly contribute to the proton gradient, it serves as another source for electrons. Complex III, or cytochrome c reductase, is where the Q cycle takes place. There is an interaction between Q and cytochromes, which are molecules composed of iron, to continue the transfer of electrons. During the Q cycle, the ubiquinol (QH2) previously produced donates electrons to ISP and cytochrome b becoming ubiquinone. ISP and cytochrome b are proteins that are located in the matrix that then transfers the electron it received from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1. Cytochrome c1 then transfers it to cytochrome c, which moves the electrons to the last complex. (Note: Unlike ubiquinone (Q), cytochrome c can only carry one electron at a time). Ubiquinone then gets reduced again to QH2, restarting the cycle. In the process, another hydrogen ion is released into the cytosol to further create the proton gradient. The cytochromes then extend into Complex IV, or cytochrome c oxidase. Electrons are transferred one at a time into the complex from cytochrome c. The electrons, in addition to hydrogen and oxygen, then react to form water in an irreversible reaction. This is the last complex that translocates four protons across the membrane to create the proton gradient that develops ATP at the end. As the proton gradient is established, F1F0 ATP synthase, sometimes referred to as Complex V, generates the ATP. The complex is composed of several subunits that bind to the protons released in prior reactions. As the protein rotates, protons are brought back into the mitochondrial matrix, allowing ADP to bind to free phosphate to produce ATP. For every full turn of the protein, three ATP is produced, concluding the electron transport chain.";
	private static String paragraph7 = "by Fine Arts in Hungary (Public Domain) Theodosius II, realizing he was defeated but unwilling to admit total defeat, asked for terms; the sum Rome now had to pay to keep the Huns from further destruction was more than tripled. The historian Will Durant writes, \"Theodosius II of the Eastern Empire and Valentinian III of the Western, both paid him tribute as a bribe to peace, disguising it among their peoples as payments for services rendered by a client king\" (39). After their Danube Offensive, Attila and Bleda led their troops back home to the Great Hungarian Plain, where Bleda then vanishes from the historical record. Kelly cites \"the most reliable Roman account\", Priscus, who writes that three years after the offensive, \"Bleda, king of the Huns, was assassinated as a result of the plots of his brother Attila\" (129). Other scholars have suggested that Bleda may have been killed on campaign but, however he died, in 445 CE, Attila became the sole leader of the Huns and the most powerful military commander in Europe. Attila's Early Reign & Honoria's Proposal The historian Jordanes (6th century CE), who wrote the only ancient account of the Goths still extant, includes their interactions with the Huns, describing Attila at length: He was a man born into the world to shake the nations, the scourge of all lands, who in some way terrified all mankind by the rumors noised abroad concerning him. He was haughty in his walk, rolling his eyes hither and thither, so that the power of his proud spirit appeared in the movement of his body. He was indeed a lover of war, yet restrained in action; mighty in counsel, gracious to suppliants, and lenient to those who were once received under his protection. He was short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard was thin and sprinkled with gray. He had a flat nose and a swarthy complexion, revealing his origin. (Jordanes, 102) Although Attila is almost always represented as a vicious warrior on horseback, slaughtering the multitudes, he was actually a more complex individual, as the Roman writer Priscus, who actually met and dined with Attila, presents him. Historian Will Durant (following the descriptions from ancient accounts like those of Priscus) writes of Attila: He differed from the other barbarian conquerors in trusting to cunning more than to force. He ruled by using the heathen superstitions of his people to sanctify his majesty; his victories were prepared by the exaggerated stories of his cruelty which perhaps he had himself originated; at last even his Christian enemies called him the \"scourge of God\" and were so terrified by his cunning that only the Goths could save them. He could neither read nor write, but this did not detract from his intelligence. He was not a savage; he had a sense of honor and justice, and often proved himself more magnanimous than the Romans. He lived and dressed simply, ate and drank moderately, and left luxury to his inferiors, who loved to display their gold and silver utensils, harness, and swords, and the delicate embroidery that attested the skillful fingers of their wives. Attila had many wives, but scorned that mixture of monogamy and debauchery which was popular in some circles of Ravenna and Rome. His palace was a huge loghouse floored and walled with planed planks, but adorned with elegantly carved or polished wood, and reinforced with carpets and skins to keep out the cold. (39) Among the \"heathen superstitions\" Durant notes is the war sword Attila carried, which he claimed was left for him by the Roman god of war, Mars. This sword, according to Jordanes, was discovered by accident: When a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound, he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass. He dug it up and took it straight to Attila. He rejoiced at this gift and, being ambitious, thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world, and that through the sword of Mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him. (102) ATTILA SAW ROME AS A FEEBLE ADVERSARY & HE AGAIN INVADED THE REGION OF MOESIA, DESTROYING OVER 70 CITIES. Attila saw Rome as a feeble adversary and so, starting in 446 or 447 CE, he again invaded the region of Moesia (the Balkan area), destroying over 70 cities, taking survivors as slaves, and sending the loot back to his stronghold at the city of Buda (possibly Budapest in present-day Hungary, though this claim has been contested by some historians). He was considered invincible and, in Durant's words, \"having bled the East to his heart's content, Attila turned to the West and found an unusual excuse for war\" (40). In 450 CE, Valentinian's sister, Honoria, was seeking to escape an arranged marriage with a Roman senator and sent a message to Attila, along with her engagement ring, asking for his help. Although she may never have intended anything like marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message and ring as a betrothal and sent back his terms as one half of the Western Empire for her dowry. Valentinian, when he discovered what his sister had done, sent messengers to Attila telling him it was all a mistake, and there was no proposal, no marriage, and no dowry to be negotiated. Attila asserted that the marriage proposal was legitimate, that he had accepted and would claim his bride, and mobilized his army to march on Rome.";
